Remember how much fun you used to have on that bike, how fast you went, how great it felt? Well, these days, most kids want an Xbox for their birthday; their parents ride around in cars with seatbelts, talking on their phones . Cycling is a thing of the past: a sport, a hobby, but rarely a mode of transportation. But I'm here to tell you: riding your bike is still fun, and still fast, and it's the cheapest and most socially responsible workout you'll ever get . And there are no two ways about it: if you give a kid a bike, that kid will ride. In Troy, New York, I met one Andrew Lynn. He's somewhat of a man brain trust , and one of his best creations is the Troy Bike Rescue . It started in 2001, when Andrew would ride around town pulling bikes out of dumpsters. He started hosting work parties with friends in his backyard, teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding. Slowly but surely, the circle grew and Andrew's backyard parties became weekly workshops. When Andrew decided to leave town for a few years' schooling in NYC, friends and cohorts took over operations. By the time Andrew returned, Troy Bike Rescue (let's call it TBR) had a life of its own. These days it's an established club, run by volunteers and donations, turning trashed bikes into treasures. Its influence now includes a legitimate downtown storefront; a sister shop in Albany ( Albany Bicycle Coalition ); movie screenings and pro-cycling political events; and a dedicated core crew that keeps everything rolling.

He started hosting work parties with friends in his backyard, teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding. Slowly but surely, the circle grew and Andrew's backyard parties became weekly workshops. When Andrew decided to leave town for a few years' schooling in NYC, friends and cohorts took over operations. By the time Andrew returned, Troy Bike Rescue (let's call it TBR) had a life of its own. These days it's an established club, run by volunteers and donations, turning trashed bikes into treasures. Its influence now includes a legitimate downtown storefront; a sister shop in Albany ( Albany Bicycle Coalition ); movie screenings and pro-cycling political events; and a dedicated core crew that keeps everything rolling.

This group understands the value of a bicycle: more than just transportation, a bike is a statement against fossil fuels. More than a toy, it's an equalizer that allows poor kids to ride with rich.

All around me, college students and bike punks tinkered with their machines. An older man asked for tips on tuning his racer. A young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he needed a new one (and, despite Andrew's stern reprimand that he couldn't just walk in every week and leave with a free bike, he did just that).

A dad came in with his three kids, all of whom left with snazzy rides -- but first, they all sat down and worked on their new wheels together. And as we left at the end of the workshop, a woman walked up to Andrew. "I love what you do," she said. "I have a whole bunch of bikes to give you." See, ultimately TBR is about more than just bicycles. It's about building community, and triggering a quiet but inexorable social movement. This is not the world's first bike collective; in fact it's only one of many that have stealthily sprung up around America. These collectives are not waiting for change to happen: they're creating it through small, positive, peaceful actions. You too can change the world: all you have to do is ride a bike. Try This at Home: Ride Around Fall is here, which (in most places) means great riding weather. What are you waiting for? Bikes are cheap: you can get one at your local thrift store for $5-50. It doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough to get you places. So pick one up, and ride it to the end of your block! Then keep going! Even if your life requires four wheels, you can use a bike for local errands. Ride it to the corner store when you need milk, instead of driving across town to the grocery store. (Don't like the milk they sell? Tell the store owner what you like, and see if he'll carry it. Now you're changing the world.) On weekends, instead of driving to the park, hop on your bike and go exploring. It doesn't have to be a workout: you can just toodle around town and look at stuff. Or, if you're a gym buff, trade a workout for a bike ride. Unless you live on a major highway, odds are you can ride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting. On vacation, rent a bike instead of a scooter (or, God forbid, a Segway). It's cheaper, and much better for the local flora&fauna. Still not convinced? Then think of it this way: by riding your bike instead of driving your car, you're reducing your consumption of fossil fuels. You can even calculate the money you save on gas, and keep it in a jar for a rainy day.

(Don't like the milk they sell? Tell the store owner what you like, and see if he'll carry it. Now you're changing the world.) On weekends, instead of driving to the park, hop on your bike and go exploring. It doesn't have to be a workout: you can just toodle around town and look at stuff. Or, if you're a gym buff, trade a workout for a bike ride. Unless you live on a major highway, odds are you can ride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting. On vacation, rent a bike instead of a scooter (or, God forbid, a Segway). It's cheaper, and much better for the local flora&fauna. Still not convinced? Then think of it this way: by riding your bike instead of driving your car, you're reducing your consumption of fossil fuels.

With his long hair, scruffy beard and t-shirt, he'd fit in more at a Phish show than behind a plow. But appearances are deceiving, and David's comfy mien belies a passion that is influencing the culture of northern Cape Cod. To wit: in 2009, David helped launch the Truro Ag Fair -- an event that exceeded all expectations and brought huge crowds to local farmers' booths. He runs the Rock Spray nursery, a Certified Natural provider of evergreens and ornamentals. And he manages the First Light Organic Farm, a lush green spot in a hollow of North Truro. Here, David and his partner Arthur Teubner work year-round growing heirloom and hardy fruits and veggies to sell at market. David's a dedicated and inspired agrarian, whose passion for farming keeps him optimistic. But farming on the Outer Cape is the sort of Sisyphian challenge that can wear anybody out. The hard truth: The soil of North Truro is not strong enough to support agriculture. Without fertilization, it deteriorates shockingly fast. David points out a patch of sand with a thin strip of fertile loam along the edge. Last season it was a fertile veggie bed -- but it was left un-fertilized as an experiment. "This is what happens," David says. "You have to keep feeding it organic material, or it turns back into sand."

The Outer Cape is really just a spit of sand -- but still, farmers lived here for generations. How? Salt marsh hay. There used to be a local tradition in this area: at each spring tide , the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes to harvest the grasses. This was called "salt marsh haying". Salt marsh hay has no weed seeds, and it doesn't compact as heavily as other types of hay. This makes it an excellent and bountiful source of compost, and it was used for generations as a soil enricher. But haying had to happen regularly, says David: "There's so much oxygen in this soil, any added compost gets burned up in six weeks. All the nutrients get depleted." That means soil left for two months without fresh compost will become -- you guessed it -- sand. The only way to keep things going here is to keep a steady flow of compost coming in. That means truckloads of hay, and that means a lot of work. Last year, David and Arthur brought in a semi truck loaded with leaf mulch. It worked -- but it cost money, and it disappeared fast into the hungry ground. Not a long-term plan. In bygone times, the whole town of North Truro would pitch in on haying days; now, David's on his own. Without that community support, it's nearly impossible for him to harvest hay often enough to keep the farm green. Meanwhile, in Tourist Town USA... The Provincetown farmers market has lovely produce, but little of it was grown on the Cape. Provincetown's official population of 3,500 supports a tourism industry that serves millions of visitors each year. City folk marvel at the quaint charms of the Cape, its idyllic beauty and simple pleasures. And then they go out to eat. Even if tourists were interested in sustainable food (they totally don't care ), they'd be hard pressed to find a locally-sourced meal. Raina Stefani serves David's produce at her restaurant Terra Luna , but it only makes up a portion of her fares: the rest has to be shipped from the mainland. You can't squeeze blood from a stone, and you can't get big vegetable crops from sand dunes. End of story. Well, not exactly. David isn't giving up -- in fact, he's got plans and ideas to refashion North Truro's farming community. Hence the Ag Fair, and the ongoing experimentation with varieties and soils at First Light. David isn't alone: he's got the support (and companionship) of a growing group of gamechangers. If the young farmers and foodies of Truro can organize, they might just be able to get local agriculture back on its feet. Their main opponent? The tourism and real estate industries, which insist upon turning every arable inch of the Cape into somebody's backyard. The same population that would consume the food produced here is actively inhibiting its production. No surprise there. After all, what's the point of farming on the beach?

blog_Uprooted_Farming-on-Sand.xml	got	STATIVE	David isn't alone: he's got the support (and companionship) of a growing group of gamechangers.	It's always been this way in North Truro. The Outer Cape is really just a spit of sand -- but still, farmers lived here for generations. How? Salt marsh hay. There used to be a local tradition in this area: at each spring tide , the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes to harvest the grasses. This was called "salt marsh haying". Salt marsh hay has no weed seeds, and it doesn't compact as heavily as other types of hay. This makes it an excellent and bountiful source of compost, and it was used for generations as a soil enricher. But haying had to happen regularly, says David: "There's so much oxygen in this soil, any added compost gets burned up in six weeks. All the nutrients get depleted." That means soil left for two months without fresh compost will become -- you guessed it -- sand. The only way to keep things going here is to keep a steady flow of compost coming in. That means truckloads of hay, and that means a lot of work. Last year, David and Arthur brought in a semi truck loaded with leaf mulch. It worked -- but it cost money, and it disappeared fast into the hungry ground. Not a long-term plan. In bygone times, the whole town of North Truro would pitch in on haying days; now, David's on his own. Without that community support, it's nearly impossible for him to harvest hay often enough to keep the farm green. Meanwhile, in Tourist Town USA...

While the immediate goal of an HTML-Math capability might have been to simply render math visually (and perhaps this was the goal of HTML-Math 3), that goal has been considerably expanded as we look at issues now. Insofar as the work of the ISO 12083 Math Committee stopped short of recommending ways to handle "semantic" aspects of math markup, recognizing that the issues were many and difficult, the work of this committee in that regard feels to me a welcome addition to the overall discussion of those sorts of problems. And as the semantics of any formal discipline lies rather closer to form than I've heard many SGML diehards acknowledge, I also welcome this committee's efforts to examine a more primitive notational base for the standard. This effort, in some sense competing with Roy Pike's, seems very healthy to me. Pike appears undissuadable in my view.

When the parser encounters something like a +_2 b, it knows by the time of reading the '+' that it must have a right operand.

When the parser sees the '+', it sees that it must be a prefix operator, and so will shift the '2' on. So, this expression would result in: {&bold {+ 2}} To get what you probably wanted, you would need to write {&bold +} 2 For a large number of cases, such as '&bold x + 2', the right thing would happen.

essays_Madame_White_Snake.xml	demonstrate	STATIVE	Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal.	Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. "From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking "Madame White Snake"." Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s. So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s. So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.
essays_Madame_White_Snake.xml	took	DYNAMIC	She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”.	Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. "From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking "Madame White Snake"." Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural.

So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. "From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking "Madame White Snake"." Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations.

Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s. So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband.

Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s. So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. "From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking "Madame White Snake"." Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful.

Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.
essays_Madame_White_Snake.xml	had	STATIVE	So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight.	Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. "From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking "Madame White Snake"." Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s. So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s. So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. "From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking "Madame White Snake"." Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358.

So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. "From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking "Madame White Snake"." Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s.

But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s. So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. "From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking "Madame White Snake"." Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52.

Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level. A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio
essays_Ohio_Steel.xml	played	DYNAMIC	During the Civil War, Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products.	In 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as Poland Township. Their blast furnace, “Hopewell,” was the very first blast furnace in the area. During the Civil War, Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products. Youngstown also was a major railway crossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago. In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.”
essays_Ohio_Steel.xml	continued	DYNAMIC	The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills.	During the 19th century, the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast (Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania) to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast, including the Mahoning Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky. By 1880, Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16,000, which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period. The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills. This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard. Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to establish a national steel workers’ union, the industry barely survived the Depression years. Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth.

essays_Ohio_Steel.xml	prohibited	DYNAMIC	This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down.	Youngstown may have been an important and prosperous region in the post-war period, but the seeds for its downfall were slowly being sown. Strikes racked the town during the forties, fifties, and sixties, and they were often long and bloody. In 1973, the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed. This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down. At the same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie. Most importantly, Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive. Old technology was not replaced, obsolete methods were not updated, and almost none of the industry’s profits were being utilized to help modernize. It was a recipe for disaster that would soon explode in the faces of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families.

The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin. Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide. Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement. However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, “If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”

Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country. Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets. Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably. It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape. The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways.

Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government. Here, too, they were ignored. The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed. Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown. They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over. The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill. Immediately after the workers left the building, US steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill.

People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general. Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down. Without a real plan, nothing could truly be achieved.

United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit. Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs. However, it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight, the international branch was not. The higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight, attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening.

Besides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism. Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism. If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism. This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do. Therefore, they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone.

essays_Ohio_Steel.xml	making	STATIVE	People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town.	From its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets. Youngstown is the name of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself. Boardman, Poland Township, Struthers, Lowellville, Warren, Lordstown, Canfield, Niles, and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown (see Figure 3). People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town. However, although traffic is heavy between each separate district, each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food. For example, Struthers is a poor town with a large Slovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread. Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist. Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools. Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic, with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side. Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding towns, and the streets are clean and well kept. With many more cultures, religions, and economic levels living in close proximity to one another, a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area: regionalism. Each town, with their own identity, instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations. Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others.

essays_Ohio_Steel.xml	agree	DYNAMIC	In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate.	With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures. Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing. A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement, because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together. In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate. In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride.

ficlets_1403.xml	was	DYNAMIC	The creature was the flapping wildly, trying to regain flight, but it still fell, falling, falling, down to earth.	It was as bleak as a day could get, the day the angel fell from the heavens. It was a cold day in November, and the only sign of life was the wind, hissing between the brown grasses and the lifeless tree branches. The ground was littered with shriveled leaves that occasionally were lifted by the wind to travel several feet before dropping back to the dull grass. At first I thought that the winged shape in the sky was a sparrow, and I was glad that a bird had come out, for it was lonely with just the hissing wind for company. But as it descended, it grew larger. It was a goose. No, all the geese had left for the winter, and it was too large now. What was it? An eagle? Could it be? No, it was too large, and it’s wings weren’t open. It wasn’t descending with control, but falling. The creature was the flapping wildly, trying to regain flight, but it still fell, falling, falling, down to earth.

It sounded like a hawk’s cry, it did. I ran towards it. It was an angel! An angel, cast down from the heavens and fallen to the earth. It’s big brown wings were twisted, and it was horribly cut from where it crashed into the tree, and yet it’s crashing into the tree very well might have saved its life, for the tree slowed its fall enough so that when it fell out of the tree, it was not hurt as badly as it would have been if it had landed on the cold, hard ground first. I ran up to it, filled first with excitement and then with concern. It was moaning, and occasionally it uttered a lamenting phrase in some incomprehensible language, and tears ran down its face. I saw that instead of a normal nose and mouth, it had a curved bird’s beak, of the sort that eagles have. I knelt beside it, not sure if I should move it inside, or if moving it might just injure it more.

Breathless, I arrived at the caravan door, and knocked sharply upon it.

Ray, a plump man who was grey where he wasn't bald. Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze. He made me a little uncomfortable. Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist. I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the crowd again later. Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact.

I could have started asking questions, but I wanted to get my bearings first. Tonight was for observation. I didn't bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people, though. They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared. I wondered at the ship instead. All the fine food and the ornamental lighting, it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain. If the barkeep was any indication, I suspected similarly high-class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship. How they were all powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got, a quality robot like that was still an energy sink. It was the brain, mostly; the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up a lot of resources.

Sarah's crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled, all seemingly pleased to have a new set of ears to talk at. I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film—done in the style of old flatscreen movies—that I had seen during off-time at Geminia Station.

Fact: It's easy to fall into patterns. I would wake late, checking the clock on my room's lightscreen to make sure I hadn't slept through brunch. I would join the rest of the ship for meals, and I would take my turn in the weight room. I would watch old films on the entertainment screens, taking mental notes for later dinnertime discussions. I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks.

Bereft of my previous familiar life, I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng, and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and then (he was mostly her favorite dancing partner; she confided to us one night that his conversational skills left something to be desired). I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth—this was my long-awaited vacation, my clean break and my temporary retreat; I'd try contacting those friends tomorrow. I continued to care little for shipwide gossip, but our discussions of films and flicks, old and new, brought out my artistic, story-loving, argumentative side, a side of me I'd tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer. It was a good life, if surreal. But I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.

Sarah's circle had picked up another newcomer, Adrienne, a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on Earth, let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her. Maybe it was her curiosity, asking a question I should have asked long before, that turned the conversation serious; maybe there was just something special about that evening. Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life, hitting some threshold or some breaking point. Regardless, when Adrienne asked what the ship's purpose was, we all gave it a measure of thought. We dredged up half-fledged theories and inchoate explanations, tossing these out the same way we pitched ideas about the art films.

A. Innovation under the Postal Reorganization Act While pre-existing law afforded limited opportunities for postal innovation,2 the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gave the newly-created United States Postal Service a clear mandate to innovate by developing effective and efficient services adapted to the needs of the Nation's mail users. Section 101(a) of Title 39 establishes the Postal Service's paramount obligation "to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people." The same section establishes the performance criterion that the Postal Service is expected to achieve as a matter of postal policy: "It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and . . . all communities." Similarly, § 403(a) assigns the Postal Service the duty to "plan, develop, promote, and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fair and reasonable rates and fees." The Act fosters service innovation by assigning the Postal Service responsibility "to provide types of mail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and mail users[.]" 39 U.S.C. § 403(b)(2). The Reorganization Act grants the Postal Service specific powers that serve as the operational tools of service innovation. Section 404 of Title 39 grants the Postal Service plenary authority over custody of the mail and its movement [§ 404(a)(1)]; over the deployment of post offices, other facilities, and equipment [§ 404(a)(3)]; and over the means by which stamps and other postage are sold [§ 404(a)(4) and (5)]. The same section also authorizes the Postal Service "to provide, establish, change, or abolish special nonpostal or similar services[.]" 39 U.S.C. § 404(a)(6). Conclusion: The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 clearly mandates that the Postal Service innovate by developing effective and efficient postal services adapted to the needs of the Nation's mail users. 2 Former 39 U.S.C. § 504(a) authorized the Postmaster General to maintain a research and development program, and to conduct experiments to enhance the operational efficiency and economy of the postal system.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed.

The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule."

A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.
govt-docs_Postal_Rate_Comm-ReportToCongress2002WEB.xml	published	STATIVE	4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R.	B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users.

The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers.

The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D.

Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed.

Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services.

Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D.

Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D.

Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time.

The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed.

A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations.

B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.5 Following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule, § 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule." Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to represent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. § 3624(a). The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter. 4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. Over the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such mail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing services. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services. Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. C. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change. The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature. These rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form. Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2. The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992. 7 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.161-.166. 8 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties. A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. "Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are held, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case. Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. In such instances, the Service's request must be supported by testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services. The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.181-.182. Postal Service, the Commission extended their application for an additional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11 Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons. 11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436 (2001). IV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law, it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service. Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs that: In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user. Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes. Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied. However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to consider "the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail" [§ 3623(c)(2)] and "the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the Postal Service" [§ 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act, these 12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp. 857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980). considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers. Conclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.

The proponent and one other mailer took the position that the Postal Service is authorized to enter into such contracts, provided the procedural requirement of review under Chapter 36 is observed. Other commenters-including the Commission's Office of Consumer Advocate-expressed doubts regarding the legal soundness of one or both of the proposed variants of such agreements. The Postal Service commented that, in its view, legal constraints would not preclude a contract mechanism in principle, but that no such arrangement would be permissible without the Commission's participation in accordance with 39 U.S.C. §§ 3622 through 3625. Upon consideration of the initial comments it received, the Commission declined to pursue the contract rate proposal, but solicited further comments on several broad issues concerning possible changes in the mail classification system. The Commission explained that its reluctance to pursue the concept of contract rates was based on substantial uncertainty regarding the legal sufficiency of examining agreed-upon rates after the fact, rather than in a prior review. It also raised the potential problems of unreasonable discrimination that such contracts might cause, in contravention of 39 U.S.C. § 403(c), and the preservation of fair contributions to the Postal Service's institutional costs by mail volumes.13 Such problems might well arise if the Service were to negotiate "discounted" rates-unaccompanied by a change in service conditions that provided cost or revenue justification. Conclusion: Negotiated rates-unaccompanied by a change in service conditions that provides cost justification-are a problematical approach to introducing additional flexibility into Postal Service business practices.

C. Negotiated Service Agreements and Specialized "Niche Classifications" Following publication of the report of the joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force on ratemaking, the Postal Service petitioned the Commission to adopt rules to implement some of the report's recommendations. One recommendation included in the Service's petition was adoption of Commission rules for reviewing on an expedited basis "service agreements with postal customers, varying from the general rate and classifications schedules in ways which add value both for the customer and for the postal system as a whole."14 The proposal in the Postal Service's petition would have established Negotiated Service Agreements as a new form of mail classification, with individual agreements to be reviewed by the Commission within 60 days. In the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, it deferred consideration of the NSA proposal, citing legal uncertainty regarding the consistency of negotiated rates with the Reorganization Act's 13 Docket No. RM89-5, Further Invitation for Comments, 54 Fed. Reg. 47223 (1989). 14 Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change, supra, at 54. ratemaking provisions. However, the Commission also expressed a general willingness to address the concept in a subsequent rulemaking. Since then, the Commission has conducted several mail classification proceedings under the other expedited procedures adopted in that rulemaking. These procedures have been shown to be well suited to the consideration of "niche classification" proposals. Niche classifications are specialized mail classifications- including reduced, but cost-justified rates or fees-that have been developed by the Postal Service in direct consultation with its customers, to meet the needs and capabilities of a mailer or group of mailers. For example, the Commission approved a two-year experiment of a program that enabled users of bulk, nonletter-size Business Reply Mail such as photofinishers that could reliably determine postage and fees due, to obtain earlier access to their mail at revised fees.15 The Commission subsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment,16 and ultimately approved a request to make the experimental program a permanent mail classification.17 More recently, in Docket No. MC2001-1, the Commission recommended three new worksharing-based discounted Priority Mail categories after negotiating with mailers who were willing to presort their mail in new ways that could reduce the Postal Service's costs.18 Such "niche classification" proposals are essentially Negotiated Service Agreements, without any associated legal uncertainties or additional administrative barriers. Conclusion: Rate and service adjustments agreed upon by the Postal Service and mailers are legally authorized if three conditions are satisfied: ❶ The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding, as the Reorganization Act requires; ❷ The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole; and 15 Docket No. MC97-1, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 2, 1997. 16 Docket No. MC99-1, Opinion and Recommended Decision Approving Revised Stipulation and Agreement, May 14, 1998. 17 Docket No. MC99-2, Opinion and Recommended Decision Approving Stipulation and Agreement, July 14, 1999. 18 See the description of this proceeding in the Appendix. ❸ The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on the same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same conditions of service.

Conclusion: Rate and service adjustments agreed upon by the Postal Service and mailers are legally authorized if three conditions are satisfied: ❶ The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding, as the Reorganization Act requires; ❷ The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole; and 15 Docket No. MC97-1, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 2, 1997. 16 Docket No. MC99-1, Opinion and Recommended Decision Approving Revised Stipulation and Agreement, May 14, 1998. 17 Docket No. MC99-2, Opinion and Recommended Decision Approving Stipulation and Agreement, July 14, 1999. 18 See the description of this proceeding in the Appendix. ❸ The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on the same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same conditions of service.

Section 1009(d) of the LSC Act explicitly provides that "neither the Corporation nor the Comptroller General shall have access to any reports or records subject to the attorneyclient privilege." In addition, section 1006(b)(3) includes both a prohibition that LSC "shall not, under any provision of this title, interfere with any attorney in carrying out his professional responsibilities" and also imposes an affirmative duty that LSC "shall ensure that activities under this title are carried out in a manner consistent with attorneys' professional responsibilities." Section 509(h) of the 1996 LSC appropriation, which has been reenacted in each subsequent year, provides that, notwithstanding section 1006(b)(3), LSC auditors and monitors are given explicit access to "financial records, time records, retainer agreements, client trust fund and eligibility records, and client names, for each recipient … except for reports or records subject to the attorney-client privilege." See United States v. Legal Services of New York City, 249 F.3d 1077 (D.C. Cir. 2001).

Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story. "Not everyone in Calcutta, or India for that matter, is unanimous in praising the nun, whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this collapsing city's poor neighborhoods. Salvation -- hers and that of the destitute she rescued from the gutters -- was her aim, not economic or social development as many others understand it, she said." It's odd, however, that in repeating this charge, the Times didn't interview the man most closely associated with it, Christopher Hitchens, or refer to the book where he set it out, The Missionary Position . Hmmm, wanna bet there was a copy of the book on somebody's desk at the Times though?

How odd -- and a good illustration of how trying to shoe-horn in a "witty" headline can drive you into an idea that doesn't fit or is undeserved. Given that Ms. Williams' parents are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a still pretty-lilly-white sport, don't be surprised if there's a bit of a complaint about this.

The 19 th century Jewish intellectuals who conceived of Zionism -- the idea that Jewish survival depends on the establishment of a Jewish state in the biblical land of Israel -- never worked out their ideology's logistics. Jewish settlement in Palestine, then part of the decaying Ottoman Empire, only proceeded piecemeal. In the 1880s and 1890s, about 25,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. Most integrated into multiethnic communities in the cities of Jaffa, Tiberias, and Jerusalem. A second wave of 30,000 immigrants came between 1905 and 1914, many of whom were Labor Zionists who wanted the Jewish state to be socialist. Extolling the virtues of manual labor, they acquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee Syrian and Lebanese landlords. The "New Palestinian Jew ," they said, needed to be physically tougher than the brainy shopkeepers who had been trampled in Europe.

By 1946, Jews owned only 7 percent of Palestine, but the perceived threat of displacement was widespread among Arabs. Starting around 1910, Arab newspapers railed against Jewish land acquisition. Among the peasantry, rumors spread alleging an Anglo-Jewish conspiracy to remove Muslims from Palestine. Anxious to avoid being blamed for Palestinian landlessness, British officials began imposing token restrictions on Jewish land purchase in 1940. They publicly supported Arab complaints that Jews were driving Arabs off the land.

journal_ArticleIP_1059.xml	drew	DYNAMIC	Urban commerce drew some peasants from their family farms.	Some historians trace Palestinian landlessness to Palestine's entry into the world economy in the 1880s. Urban commerce drew some peasants from their family farms. Other subsistence farmers found themselves competing with cash-crop entrepreneurs (Jews and Arabs) whose successes changed the face of Palestinian agriculture. Jewish land purchases were not the primary factor, these historians say.
journal_ArticleIP_1059.xml	are	DYNAMIC	Jewish sovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are: by war.	Very little of the land owned today by individual Jews and the Israeli government was acquired by purchase. Jewish sovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are: by war. Israel confiscated all land owned by the British government, mostly desert and mountains, after the 1948 War of Independence . Property owned by Arab refugees, who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by the Israeli army (another long-standing controversy), was also taken over by individual Jews or confiscated by the government. Many Palestinians, however, stayed put, retained their land, and became Israeli citizens.

journal_ArticleIP_1059.xml	intended	DYNAMIC	However, even these revisionists agree that the Jews had not intended to evict Muslims from Palestine.	A new school of Jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by Jewish land acquisition, and concludes that it was not always fair. One popular theory compares Zionism's imperative to acquire land to the American idea of Manifest Destiny (that it was the United States' God-given right to rule from coast to coast). Others argue that it was a mistake for the Jewish National Fund to prohibit non-Jewish laborers from the newly purchased lands. However, even these revisionists agree that the Jews had not intended to evict Muslims from Palestine.
journal_ArticleIP_1059.xml	According	DYNAMIC	According to British land records, the Jerusalem mufti's 1934 decree failed to prevent sales.	In the past, death threats have done little to deter sales of land. According to British land records, the Jerusalem mufti's 1934 decree failed to prevent sales. But that decree did not have the power of civil law behind it. Nevertheless, the incentives to sell at the market price are substantial, and if the threats create new scarcities, higher prices will probably encourage sellers to unload their land.
journal_ArticleIP_1060.xml	rejected	DYNAMIC	Last week, the Senate rejected Majority Leader Tom Daschle's bill banning the abortion of "viable fetuses."	"Viability" has become the focus of the abortion debate. Last week, the Senate rejected Majority Leader Tom Daschle's bill banning the abortion of "viable fetuses." But William Bennett and William Safire hailed Daschle's bill as the great compromise that might settle a quarter century of arguments about abortion. Forty-one states already restrict the abortion of viable fetuses. What is a viable fetus? How is the concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues of abortion?
journal_ArticleIP_1060.xml	ruled	DYNAMIC	The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot put the interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the fetus is "viable."	Roe vs. Wade , the 1973 case legalizing abortion, made fetal viability an important legal concept . The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot put the interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the fetus is "viable." The court defined viable to mean capable of prolonged life outside the mother's womb. It said this included fetuses that doctors expected to be sustained by respirators. The court accepted the conventional medical wisdom that a fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of a pregnancy, the third trimester, sometime between the 24 th and 28 th week (a pregnancy usually lasts 38 weeks). Because the point of viability varies, the court ruled, it could only be determined case by case and by the woman's own doctor. Even if the fetus is viable, the court said, states could not outlaw an abortion if the woman's life or health was at stake.

journal_ArticleIP_1060.xml	allowing	DYNAMIC	She said that improvements in technology would continually push the point of fetal viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy, allowing states greater opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion.	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued in a 1983 decision that Roe was on a "collision course with itself." She said that improvements in technology would continually push the point of fetal viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy, allowing states greater opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion. And this seems to be the case -- up to a point. Doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the 23 rd week -- a week earlier than was thought 24 years ago. Most hospitals will only perform abortions through the 22 nd week of pregnancy.

But no baby has ever been successfully delivered before the middle of the 22 nd week. Babies delivered during the 22 nd and 23 rd weeks weigh just over a pound. Their lungs have barely formed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale. Circulation depends on the use of ventilators and injections of hormones. A baby born during the 22 nd week has a 14.8 percent chance of survival. And about half of these survivors are brain-damaged, either by lack of oxygen (from poor initial respiration) or too much oxygen (from the ventilator). Neonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the 22 nd week, because before then the lungs are not fully formed.

Some medical ethicists and constitutional scholars say that the Supreme Court was wrong to create the pre-viability/post-viability distinction in the first place. Why, they ask, does the fact that a fetus can survive outside the womb with the help of vast medical technology change either of the interests at war in the abortion debate: the fetus's own claim to "human-ness" and a woman's right to control her body? Even if viability is an important moral line, is it drawn in the right place? Keeping alive a baby born in the 22 nd week costs several hundred thousand dollars and usually fails, regardless of the effort.

I’m sure you’ve heard of us either directly or by our publications and activities. We are one of America’s largest and most successful conservation and education groups. Ever hear of Ranger Rick the famous children’s wildlife magazine? That’s us! Ranger Rick is just one of our many wildlife publications. We also publish Your Big Backyard and Wild Animal Baby. And we’re famous for distributing the one magazine in America that’s been called “the world’s most beautiful nature magazine,” the award-winning NATIONAL WILDLIFE. As a member you’ll play a role in educating millions of Americans — young and old alike — through these outstanding wildlife publications and many other related activities such as distributing Wildlife Week materials to millions of American schoolchildren each year. (over, please...) For more than 60 years, caring and concerned wildlife lovers like yourself have supported our mission to educate, inspire and assist individuals and organizations to conserve wildlife and other natural resources and to protect the earth’s environment in order to achieve a peaceful, equitable and sustainable future. That’s what it’s all about securing a place for wildlife in the modern world. Today you have the opportunity to join this successful cause by becoming a member of NWF for as little as $15 .

Our magazine is a great way to stay informed on the current issues affecting wildlife and see what NWF is doing to find solutions to these problems. And you’ll enjoy a series of insightful stories on a variety of wildlife species stories that can’t be found anywhere else! As an added welcome gift, we will send you an exclusive NWF tote bag. When you use it in place of plastic bags you help conserve our natural resources. The tote bag is made of a strong, cotton material and has plenty of room, including a handy sewn-in pocket. And it’s a great way to show your commitment to conservation every day. We are constantly working in every part of the country to save those species and special places that are in all of our minds. Here are some of the projects in the forefront at NWF right now: Working to improve the water quality and water flow in the Florida Everglades so magnificent creatures like the gentle manatee can survive. Reintroducing the grizzly bear into the Selway-Bitterroot wilderness area of Idaho and Montana. Building on our success of reintroducing the gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park by expanding gray wolf recovery into suitable habitat in the United States. Your gift is needed now to support these critical projects and so many others. Despite our many victories, we still have far to go to ensure a healthy future for the wildlife and wild places of this nation. So, please take a moment right now and become a member of NWF with a gift of only $15 or more. You will be making a world of difference in helping us continue to fight for the species that can’t fight for themselves. Appreciatively, Tom McGuire Vice President, Membership Programs P.S.

Reintroducing the grizzly bear into the Selway-Bitterroot wilderness area of Idaho and Montana. Building on our success of reintroducing the gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park by expanding gray wolf recovery into suitable habitat in the United States. Your gift is needed now to support these critical projects and so many others. Despite our many victories, we still have far to go to ensure a healthy future for the wildlife and wild places of this nation. So, please take a moment right now and become a member of NWF with a gift of only $15 or more. You will be making a world of difference in helping us continue to fight for the species that can’t fight for themselves. Appreciatively, Tom McGuire Vice President, Membership Programs P.S.

news_wsj_1640.mrg-NEW.xml	share	DYNAMIC	"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies," said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md.	Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. "Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies," said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. It "may well be" that theft of business data is "as serious a strategic threat to national security" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air. Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder. They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait. "You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time," Mr. Matchett said, adding : "It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught." The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information. Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said. By contrast, European firms will spend $150 million this year on electronic security, and are expected to spend $1 billion by 1992. Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported. Still, encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy. One expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies. Moreover, he said, technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they've been "erased" from a computer's memory. He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read. No personal computer, not even the one on a chief executive's desk, is safe, this speaker noted. W. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm that makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known commonly as glasnost. Under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Goode said, the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications. He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East. Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which hadn't been invited to submit a bid. The Soviets' eavesdropping paid off, however, because they got the contract.

Under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Goode said, the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications. He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East. Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which hadn't been invited to submit a bid. The Soviets' eavesdropping paid off, however, because they got the contract.

Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. "Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies," said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. It "may well be" that theft of business data is "as serious a strategic threat to national security" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air. Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder. They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait. "You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time," Mr. Matchett said, adding : "It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught." The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information.

Exciting, mysterious, glamorous — these words have described Hong Kong for at least a century. With its vibrant atmosphere and night-and-day activity it is an intoxicating place. Hong Kong is crowded — it has one of the world’s greatest population densities. But it is also efficient, with one of the best transportation systems anywhere, and for such a crowded place, quiet — you don’t hear voices raised in anger, motorists sitting on their horns, or loud boomboxes. Shopping never ends — there’s always another inviting spot just down the street. You’ll find Hong Kong easy to get around, the people helpful, English spoken everywhere, and food that lives up to its reputation. On 1 July, 1997 the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact, and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years. Beijing’s announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability makes sense. Hong Kong has long been China’s handiest window on the West, and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know-how and managerial expertise. Around the time of the transition there was much speculation about how things would change. But in fact, once news of the handover vanished from the front pages, the people of Hong Kong returned to their usual topics of conversation: the economy and the price of housing. The impression of the visitor today will be that very little has changed. Establishments are no longer called “Royal,” Queen Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage, and the Union Jack has been replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its bauhinia flower. But in fact, there have been changes, many of them due to economic progress, new construction, and other factors that influence cities all over the world. Others are more subtle. British social customs are still evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour. The British population has decreased; today there are as many American and Australian ex-pats as there are British. With a population of nearly eight million and a total area of just over 1,095 square km (423 square miles), housing is one of Hong Kong’s perennial nightmares. To alleviate the problem, the government has become the city’s major landlord with the construction of massive apartment blocks that, though they have every modern facility, average only 9 square m (100 square ft) in size. Whole cities have been created in the New Territories, although the unimaginative architecture of these towns has been criticized. Of Hong Kong’s population, 98 percent are Chinese. The majority are Cantonese, born in Hong Kong, or from South China, but there are immigrants from all over China. The Chinese people have been described as hardworking and pragmatic, attitudes that have contributed to Hong Kong’s success. There are many stories of refugees who arrived with nothing in their pockets, set up a small sidewalk stall, worked diligently until they had their own store, and then expanded it into a modest chain. Old customs are still followed: Fate and luck are taken very seriously, and astrologers and fortune-tellers do a steady business. Before a skyscraper can be built, a feng shui (see page 68) investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building will promote health, harmony, and prosperity. You’ll also notice that gambling is a passion, whether it be cards, mah-jong, the lottery, or the horses. Hong Kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive off-track betting system, and on weekends the ferries to Macau are crowded with people on their way to the casinos. Sightseeing in Hong Kong starts at sea level with the enthralling water traffic — a mix of freighters, ferries, tugs, junks, and yachts. Views of the city and the harbor are panoramic. From Victoria Peak, Hong Kong’s highest point, or from skyscrapers and hotels, they are especially exciting at night when the lights are on. The business and financial center and the signature soaring architecture are on Hong Kong Island. Across Victoria Harbor, connected by ferry and the MTR rail line, is the Kowloon peninsula with its hotels, nightlife, and almost non-stop shopping. Beyond, in the New Territories, are a mixture of high-rise suburban towns, ancient sites and walled villages, country parks, and farms with ducks and fish ponds. Hong Kong’s other, less developed islands, Lantau, Lamma, and Cheung Chau, provide getaways. You can also take a ferry to Macau to find an entirely different kind of city, a unique blend of Chinese and Iberian culture. It’s anyone’s guess what may happen in the future, but for now Hong Kong bristles with energy and ambition, and for the visitor, this beautiful city with its contrasts and variety is an exhilarating experience.

travel_IntroHongKong.xml	continue	STATIVE	Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact, and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years.	Exciting, mysterious, glamorous — these words have described Hong Kong for at least a century. With its vibrant atmosphere and night-and-day activity it is an intoxicating place. Hong Kong is crowded — it has one of the world’s greatest population densities. But it is also efficient, with one of the best transportation systems anywhere, and for such a crowded place, quiet — you don’t hear voices raised in anger, motorists sitting on their horns, or loud boomboxes. Shopping never ends — there’s always another inviting spot just down the street. You’ll find Hong Kong easy to get around, the people helpful, English spoken everywhere, and food that lives up to its reputation. On 1 July, 1997 the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact, and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years. Beijing’s announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability makes sense. Hong Kong has long been China’s handiest window on the West, and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know-how and managerial expertise. Around the time of the transition there was much speculation about how things would change. But in fact, once news of the handover vanished from the front pages, the people of Hong Kong returned to their usual topics of conversation: the economy and the price of housing. The impression of the visitor today will be that very little has changed. Establishments are no longer called “Royal,” Queen Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage, and the Union Jack has been replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its bauhinia flower. But in fact, there have been changes, many of them due to economic progress, new construction, and other factors that influence cities all over the world. Others are more subtle. British social customs are still evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour. The British population has decreased; today there are as many American and Australian ex-pats as there are British. With a population of nearly eight million and a total area of just over 1,095 square km (423 square miles), housing is one of Hong Kong’s perennial nightmares. To alleviate the problem, the government has become the city’s major landlord with the construction of massive apartment blocks that, though they have every modern facility, average only 9 square m (100 square ft) in size. Whole cities have been created in the New Territories, although the unimaginative architecture of these towns has been criticized. Of Hong Kong’s population, 98 percent are Chinese. The majority are Cantonese, born in Hong Kong, or from South China, but there are immigrants from all over China. The Chinese people have been described as hardworking and pragmatic, attitudes that have contributed to Hong Kong’s success. There are many stories of refugees who arrived with nothing in their pockets, set up a small sidewalk stall, worked diligently until they had their own store, and then expanded it into a modest chain. Old customs are still followed: Fate and luck are taken very seriously, and astrologers and fortune-tellers do a steady business. Before a skyscraper can be built, a feng shui (see page 68) investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building will promote health, harmony, and prosperity. You’ll also notice that gambling is a passion, whether it be cards, mah-jong, the lottery, or the horses. Hong Kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive off-track betting system, and on weekends the ferries to Macau are crowded with people on their way to the casinos. Sightseeing in Hong Kong starts at sea level with the enthralling water traffic — a mix of freighters, ferries, tugs, junks, and yachts. Views of the city and the harbor are panoramic. From Victoria Peak, Hong Kong’s highest point, or from skyscrapers and hotels, they are especially exciting at night when the lights are on.

Beyond, in the New Territories, are a mixture of high-rise suburban towns, ancient sites and walled villages, country parks, and farms with ducks and fish ponds. Hong Kong’s other, less developed islands, Lantau, Lamma, and Cheung Chau, provide getaways. You can also take a ferry to Macau to find an entirely different kind of city, a unique blend of Chinese and Iberian culture.

travel_IntroHongKong.xml	taken	STATIVE	Old customs are still followed: Fate and luck are taken very seriously, and astrologers and fortune-tellers do a steady business.	Exciting, mysterious, glamorous — these words have described Hong Kong for at least a century. With its vibrant atmosphere and night-and-day activity it is an intoxicating place.

You’ll find Hong Kong easy to get around, the people helpful, English spoken everywhere, and food that lives up to its reputation. On 1 July, 1997 the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact, and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years. Beijing’s announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability makes sense. Hong Kong has long been China’s handiest window on the West, and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know-how and managerial expertise. Around the time of the transition there was much speculation about how things would change. But in fact, once news of the handover vanished from the front pages, the people of Hong Kong returned to their usual topics of conversation: the economy and the price of housing. The impression of the visitor today will be that very little has changed. Establishments are no longer called “Royal,” Queen Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage, and the Union Jack has been replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its bauhinia flower. But in fact, there have been changes, many of them due to economic progress, new construction, and other factors that influence cities all over the world. Others are more subtle. British social customs are still evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour. The British population has decreased; today there are as many American and Australian ex-pats as there are British. With a population of nearly eight million and a total area of just over 1,095 square km (423 square miles), housing is one of Hong Kong’s perennial nightmares. To alleviate the problem, the government has become the city’s major landlord with the construction of massive apartment blocks that, though they have every modern facility, average only 9 square m (100 square ft) in size. Whole cities have been created in the New Territories, although the unimaginative architecture of these towns has been criticized. Of Hong Kong’s population, 98 percent are Chinese. The majority are Cantonese, born in Hong Kong, or from South China, but there are immigrants from all over China. The Chinese people have been described as hardworking and pragmatic, attitudes that have contributed to Hong Kong’s success. There are many stories of refugees who arrived with nothing in their pockets, set up a small sidewalk stall, worked diligently until they had their own store, and then expanded it into a modest chain. Old customs are still followed: Fate and luck are taken very seriously, and astrologers and fortune-tellers do a steady business. Before a skyscraper can be built, a feng shui (see page 68) investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building will promote health, harmony, and prosperity. You’ll also notice that gambling is a passion, whether it be cards, mah-jong, the lottery, or the horses. Hong Kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive off-track betting system, and on weekends the ferries to Macau are crowded with people on their way to the casinos.

travel_WhatToHongKong.xml	come	STATIVE	Specialty goods and souvenirs, often handmade, come from Hong Kong and elsewhere in China.	Inflation has taken its toll in Hong Kong. While it’s no longer the bargain shopping destination it once was, there are still some good buys to be had. Since Hong Kong is a duty-free port and charges no sales tax, goods are cheaper here than in the country where they were made. On photographic equipment, electronic goods, and watches, you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home country. Specialty goods and souvenirs, often handmade, come from Hong Kong and elsewhere in China. Custom-made garments by skillful Hong Kong tailors are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable garments. Note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to Hong Kong’s duty-free regime and are subject to tax. You’ll find that prices are about the same in Hong Kong Central and Kowloon, and somewhat cheaper in Causeway Bay, which caters to local shopping. Large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to be more expensive than smaller “family” shops tucked away in the side streets. Stores do not open until 10am or later, but shopping goes on into the evening, up to 9:30pm. Most shops are open seven days a week. Shops in Central are an exception; they generally close at 6pm and are not open on Sunday. The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a halt is the Chinese New Year in January or February. Buyer Beware. Be aware that name brands, including electronics, are sometimes fakes, glass may be sold as jade, and that antique you bought may have been made last night. Always ask for a receipt that records information about the item, and if you buy an antique, be sure to get a certificate of authentication. Needless to say, avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take you to wondrous bargains. The large department stores have fixed prices, but elsewhere you should ask whether there is a discount, especially if you buy several items in one shop. Compare prices before you buy any significant item. Always ask to see the manufacturer’s guarantee when purchasing watches, cameras, and audio-visual and electronic equipment. Note that when haggling, the merchant assumes you are prepared to pay cash. If, after concluding a deal, you try to pay with a credit card, he may then boost the price in order to cover the card charges. It is advisable to shop at outlets that are members of the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), identified by a red junk logo. Membership imposes an obligation to maintain standards of both quality and service, and provides dissatisfied customers with an officially recognized channel for redressing complaints; the number to call is Tel. 2508 1234. Pick up a copy of HKTA’s “The Official Dining, Entertainment & Shopping Directory” in which all member stores are listed. Shipping. Many stores will pack and ship purchases. Ask if automatic free insurance is provided. If the goods are very valuable or fragile, it is a good idea to buy an all-risk insurance for the shipment. Packages sent to the US or to Europe generally take six to eight weeks by surface mail, and one week by airmail. Shopping Areas. Major shopping areas are Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon, especially along Nathan Road; Central on Hong Kong Island, particularly for upscale designer goods; Causeway Bay for slightly better prices; and the Hollywood Road area. Department Stores. Look for Lane Crawford Ltd., an upscale store with branches at Pacific Place, 70 Queen’s Road, and Harbour City; Wing On, one of the oldest in Hong Kong; Marks and Spencer; and the Japanese department stores, Mitsukoshi, Sobo, and Seibu. Malls. Hong Kong is full of giant malls. Harbour City, just west of the Star Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui is one of the largest; Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, is Central’s biggest mall, with retail outlets and department stores; Times Square is a collection of retail outlets in Causeway Bay. In addition, most top-line hotels have upscale malls full of designer boutiques. Factory Outlets. These stores sell excess stock or factory overruns. Hong Kong is no longer a factory outlet center since much of its clothing manufacturing has moved elsewhere. There are factory showrooms in the Pedder Building, 12 Pedder Street, in Central. Markets. Markets are the places to use your bargaining skills. Hong Kong’s most famous and colorful market is the Temple Street Night Market near the Jordan MTR stop. Every conceivable kind of goods is sold here: clothing, all kinds of electronics, CDs, souvenirs, crafts, and jewelry. Stanley Market is located on Hong Kong’s southern coast, and is well-known for all kinds of clothing, including silk and cashmere. Bargain, and carefully examine any merchandise you buy here. The Jade Market, on Kansu Street in Yau Ma Tei, is known for both jade and freshwater pearls. This is not the place to make expensive purchases, but it’s great for inexpensive pendants, earrings, and gifts.

Stanley Market is located on Hong Kong’s southern coast, and is well-known for all kinds of clothing, including silk and cashmere. Bargain, and carefully examine any merchandise you buy here. The Jade Market, on Kansu Street in Yau Ma Tei, is known for both jade and freshwater pearls. This is not the place to make expensive purchases, but it’s great for inexpensive pendants, earrings, and gifts.
travel_WhatToHongKong.xml	offer	DYNAMIC	Needless to say, avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take you to wondrous bargains.	Inflation has taken its toll in Hong Kong. While it’s no longer the bargain shopping destination it once was, there are still some good buys to be had. Since Hong Kong is a duty-free port and charges no sales tax, goods are cheaper here than in the country where they were made. On photographic equipment, electronic goods, and watches, you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home country. Specialty goods and souvenirs, often handmade, come from Hong Kong and elsewhere in China. Custom-made garments by skillful Hong Kong tailors are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable garments. Note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to Hong Kong’s duty-free regime and are subject to tax. You’ll find that prices are about the same in Hong Kong Central and Kowloon, and somewhat cheaper in Causeway Bay, which caters to local shopping. Large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to be more expensive than smaller “family” shops tucked away in the side streets. Stores do not open until 10am or later, but shopping goes on into the evening, up to 9:30pm. Most shops are open seven days a week. Shops in Central are an exception; they generally close at 6pm and are not open on Sunday. The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a halt is the Chinese New Year in January or February. Buyer Beware. Be aware that name brands, including electronics, are sometimes fakes, glass may be sold as jade, and that antique you bought may have been made last night. Always ask for a receipt that records information about the item, and if you buy an antique, be sure to get a certificate of authentication. Needless to say, avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take you to wondrous bargains. The large department stores have fixed prices, but elsewhere you should ask whether there is a discount, especially if you buy several items in one shop. Compare prices before you buy any significant item. Always ask to see the manufacturer’s guarantee when purchasing watches, cameras, and audio-visual and electronic equipment. Note that when haggling, the merchant assumes you are prepared to pay cash. If, after concluding a deal, you try to pay with a credit card, he may then boost the price in order to cover the card charges. It is advisable to shop at outlets that are members of the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), identified by a red junk logo. Membership imposes an obligation to maintain standards of both quality and service, and provides dissatisfied customers with an officially recognized channel for redressing complaints; the number to call is Tel. 2508 1234. Pick up a copy of HKTA’s “The Official Dining, Entertainment & Shopping Directory” in which all member stores are listed. Shipping. Many stores will pack and ship purchases. Ask if automatic free insurance is provided. If the goods are very valuable or fragile, it is a good idea to buy an all-risk insurance for the shipment. Packages sent to the US or to Europe generally take six to eight weeks by surface mail, and one week by airmail. Shopping Areas. Major shopping areas are Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon, especially along Nathan Road; Central on Hong Kong Island, particularly for upscale designer goods; Causeway Bay for slightly better prices; and the Hollywood Road area. Department Stores. Look for Lane Crawford Ltd., an upscale store with branches at Pacific Place, 70 Queen’s Road, and Harbour City; Wing On, one of the oldest in Hong Kong; Marks and Spencer; and the Japanese department stores, Mitsukoshi, Sobo, and Seibu. Malls. Hong Kong is full of giant malls. Harbour City, just west of the Star Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui is one of the largest; Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, is Central’s biggest mall, with retail outlets and department stores; Times Square is a collection of retail outlets in Causeway Bay. In addition, most top-line hotels have upscale malls full of designer boutiques. Factory Outlets. These stores sell excess stock or factory overruns. Hong Kong is no longer a factory outlet center since much of its clothing manufacturing has moved elsewhere. There are factory showrooms in the Pedder Building, 12 Pedder Street, in Central. Markets.

travel_WhatToHongKong.xml	attributed	STATIVE	“ Good for the health” is just one of the many magical qualities that are attributed to these beautiful emerald-green or turquoise stones.	Antiques. Hollywood Road in the Mid-Levels above Central is the most famous antiques street in Hong Kong. Look for fine Chinese bronzes, embroidery, lacquerware and porcelain, tomb figures, and wood carvings, among other possibilities. The experts point out that it is not age alone that determines a Chinese antique’s value — the dynasties of the past had their creative ups and downs. For serious antiques, try Honeychurch Antiques at no. 29 for furniture and silver, Tai Sing Company at 122 for porcelain. For fun you can visit the Low Price Shop at no. 47 or the Cat Street crafts stores and flea market. Brocades and Silks. Fabrics from China are a bargain and well worth taking home. Chinese-product department stores stock silk fabrics, silk scarves, finely embroidered blouses, and traditional padded jackets. Chinese Arts and Crafts is at Pacific Place in Central, and in Star House in Tsim Sha Tsui; CRC Department Store is on Hennessy Road in Causeway Bay. For fabrics, also try Western Market, Morrison Street, in Central. Cameras. Photo buffs know that Hong Kong is the place to buy some of the world’s most advanced photographic equipment, and there are some real bargains around. However, be sure you compare prices and models before buying. Two reliable places to start looking in Lan Kwai Fong are Photo Scientific in the Eurasia Building and Hing Lee Camera Company, 25 Lyndhurst Terrace. Carpets and Rugs. Hong Kong is a mecca for Chinese hand-knotted wool carpets and silk rugs. Hong Kong’s stores are usually able to arrange shipment. Caravan at 65 Hollywood Road and the shops in The Silk Road at Ocean Center in Tsim Sha Tsui are good places to start looking. China (Porcelain). In Hong Kong you can have a plate, or even a whole dinner service, hand-painted to your own design. Factories in Kowloon and the New Territories, producing traditional and modern china, are geared to entertain and instruct visiting tourists; prices are appealing. Two of the largest places to go are the Wah Tung China Company in the Grand Marine Industrial Building in Aberdeen; and the Overjoy Porcelain Factory in Block B of the Kwai Hing Industrial Building, Kwai Chung, in the New Territories. In antiques shops, look for highly valued porcelains from China. Note that because of the duty-free situation, good bargains may be found in European china, including Spode and Wedgwood. Electronics. The latest gadgets are sometimes available in Hong Kong before anywhere else. Before you begin shopping, pick up HKTA’s “Shopping Guide to Consumer Electronics. ” Prices on electronics have risen in the past two years; check prices at home before you buy here. Nathan Road has many electronics shops. Also check out Star Computer City in the Star House near the Star Ferry terminal. Furniture. The choice ranges from traditional hand-carved Chinese rosewood furniture to well-made reproductions of modern Western styles. Rattan furniture is highly popular. Hollywood Road has several furniture shops. Queen’s Road East in Wan Chai is a furniture manufacturing and retail area. Jade. “ Good for the health” is just one of the many magical qualities that are attributed to these beautiful emerald-green or turquoise stones. Real jade is extremely expensive, and you may be offered counterfeit jade, which looks exactly like the genuine article. Some people say you can test the authenticity by touch — real jade feels smooth and cool. Alternatively, you can shine a lamp on the stone — real jade shows no reflected light. Better still, go shopping with an expert. Jewelry. Thanks to the duty-free situation, prices in Hong Kong are lower than they are in some other places. You can buy gemstones loose or set, or have them made up to your own design. Popular purchases include diamonds and freshwater pearls. If you do plan to buy jewelry, be sure to consult the “Shopping Guide to Jewellery” published by the Hong Kong Tourist Authority to find a reputable dealer. Kitchen Equipment. Woks and any other gadgets essential for Chinese cookery make good purchases. Department stores sell all sorts of intriguing kitchen equipment. Leather Goods. Leather is not a great bargain in Hong Kong. Locally made items do not live up to their European models. However, the leather garment industry is growing, and there is a wide range of locally produced leather accessories, all at extremely attractive prices. For European imports, you will pay top dollar. Musical, Audio, and Video Equipment. Hong Kong has a vast range of the most high-tech audio-visual, sound, and screen equipment. Before purchasing, visitors should make sure of compatibility with systems in their own countries. Be sure to look around and compare before buying. Whatever you buy, you may be able to work out a discount. Ready-to-wear Clothes. Hong Kong’s shops carry almost every recognizable European and many American labels, from top-end designers to the moderately priced or trendy. Nathan Road, Central, and the hotel malls are places to look. There are still a great many factory outlet stores with reasonable prices. You’ll also find bargain clothes for sale at the markets and on push-carts. Tailoring. Tailor-made clothes are not as popular in Hong Kong as they were in the past, but hundreds of shops still remain. Local tailors are experts when it comes to producing custom-tailored garments for both men and women, and are also adept at copying patterns. The result can be a quality suit at a fair price — but made-to-measure clothing is not cheap. In choosing a tailor, look for HKTA membership. Many tailors have Web sites or are listed on Web sites. Tea. Shops all over town will sell you gift tins of exotic blends. If you want to learn something about tea, go to the Tea Shop at 149 Hollywood Road, or the Moon Garden Tea House at 5 Hoi Ping Road, Causeway Bay. The owners will brew up a pot so you can taste before making a choice. Watches. The saying “Time is money” is quite literally true in Hong Kong: more is spent on watches and clocks here than on cameras and optical goods. An enormous variety of makes and models are on sale. Be sure to get the manufacturer’s guarantee stamped or signed if you buy a watch. Entertainment Day and night, the action goes on in this vibrant city. To help you choose a nightlife scene, pick up a copy of Hong Kong Tourist Authority’s dining and entertainment guide for listings, or just simply wander through the maze of neon signs and take your pick. Hong Kong Diary published weekly by HKTA tells what’s happening in the arts. Hong Kong Life is published by the Hong Kong Standard on Sunday, and the South China Morning Post has an entertainment section on Friday. Culture buffs are well catered to, and there is always a varied program of events, ranging from world-class concerts to local amateur dramatic productions. A highlight of the arts calendar is the annual Hong Kong Arts Festival, a three-week dose of international culture in February, with concerts, recitals, plays, jazz, Chinese opera, and innovative productions put on by leading talent from both East and West. Tickets for the shows must be reserved well in advance. The Festival of Asian Arts takes place every other October, bringing to Hong Kong for two weeks orchestras, dance groups, opera, and drama companies from all over Asia. There are more than 30 cinemas in Hong Kong, and the latest Western releases are shown in some of the larger ones. English-language films have Chinese subtitles. Films with Mandarin dialogue also have Chinese subtitles, for the benefit of Cantonese speakers, and sometimes subtitles in English. The Hong Kong International Film Festival takes place in April. More than 200 films from all over the world are shown at this two-week event. Ask at City Hall center about advance reservations. The Performing Arts Performance Venues. The theaters in the Hong Kong Cultural Center in Tsim Sha Tsui are the main venues for concerts and opera. Other performance centers are the City Hall cultural complex, with exhibition halls and theaters that present concerts, plays, and films; the Hong Kong Academy for the Performing Arts with two major theaters for dance, drama, and concert performances; and the Hong Kong Arts Centre in Wan Chai, where both local and visiting groups perform. Other centers for concerts, plays, and entertainment are Sha Tin Town Hall and Tsuen Wan Town Hall in the New Territories. Larger arenas, including the Queen Elizabeth Stadium, the Hong Kong Coliseum, and the Ko Shan Theater in Kowloon play host to various concerts, pop concerts, sporting events, and variety shows. Classical Music. The Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra performs new and traditional works; a wide assortment of traditional and Chinese instruments are featured. The Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in 1975. Under its conductor, David Atherton, it offers Western classical works and new works by Chinese composers in a September-to-June season. Chinese Opera. Cantonese opera is alive and well in Hong Kong, and the two other forms, Beijing and Kun, are sometimes presented. To most foreigners, this unique art form is likely to be inscrutable at first exposure, but everyone can appreciate the spectacle and the elaborate, glittering costumes. Although the music may seem strange to the unaccustomed ear, it certainly won’t put you to sleep; cymbals and drums guarantee your alertness. Dance. Hong Kong’s three professional dance companies — the Hong Kong Ballet Company, the Hong Kong Dance Company, and the newer City Contemporary Dance Company — perform regularly, often at the Hong Kong Academy for the Performing Arts. Theater. The two leading local troupes, the Chung Ying Theatre Company and the Hong Kong Repertory Theatre, perform in Cantonese; there are English-language performances at the Fringe Club theaters, 2 Lower Albert Road, in Central. Puppet Shows. The classic Chinese puppet is the shadow puppet, manipulated behind a screen by three rods, but hand puppet and marionette shows are also on offer, often for free at public parks and playgrounds. Nightlife Hong Kong by night can suit any taste — riotous, sedate, raw, or cultured.

travel_WhatToHongKong.xml	accompanied	STATIVE	There’s a special Kid’s World that those under 12 can enter free when accompanied by a paying adult.	Antiques. Hollywood Road in the Mid-Levels above Central is the most famous antiques street in Hong Kong. Look for fine Chinese bronzes, embroidery, lacquerware and porcelain, tomb figures, and wood carvings, among other possibilities. The experts point out that it is not age alone that determines a Chinese antique’s value — the dynasties of the past had their creative ups and downs. For serious antiques, try Honeychurch Antiques at no. 29 for furniture and silver, Tai Sing Company at 122 for porcelain. For fun you can visit the Low Price Shop at no. 47 or the Cat Street crafts stores and flea market. Brocades and Silks. Fabrics from China are a bargain and well worth taking home. Chinese-product department stores stock silk fabrics, silk scarves, finely embroidered blouses, and traditional padded jackets. Chinese Arts and Crafts is at Pacific Place in Central, and in Star House in Tsim Sha Tsui; CRC Department Store is on Hennessy Road in Causeway Bay. For fabrics, also try Western Market, Morrison Street, in Central. Cameras. Photo buffs know that Hong Kong is the place to buy some of the world’s most advanced photographic equipment, and there are some real bargains around. However, be sure you compare prices and models before buying. Two reliable places to start looking in Lan Kwai Fong are Photo Scientific in the Eurasia Building and Hing Lee Camera Company, 25 Lyndhurst Terrace. Carpets and Rugs. Hong Kong is a mecca for Chinese hand-knotted wool carpets and silk rugs. Hong Kong’s stores are usually able to arrange shipment. Caravan at 65 Hollywood Road and the shops in The Silk Road at Ocean Center in Tsim Sha Tsui are good places to start looking. China (Porcelain). In Hong Kong you can have a plate, or even a whole dinner service, hand-painted to your own design. Factories in Kowloon and the New Territories, producing traditional and modern china, are geared to entertain and instruct visiting tourists; prices are appealing. Two of the largest places to go are the Wah Tung China Company in the Grand Marine Industrial Building in Aberdeen; and the Overjoy Porcelain Factory in Block B of the Kwai Hing Industrial Building, Kwai Chung, in the New Territories. In antiques shops, look for highly valued porcelains from China. Note that because of the duty-free situation, good bargains may be found in European china, including Spode and Wedgwood. Electronics. The latest gadgets are sometimes available in Hong Kong before anywhere else. Before you begin shopping, pick up HKTA’s “Shopping Guide to Consumer Electronics. ” Prices on electronics have risen in the past two years; check prices at home before you buy here. Nathan Road has many electronics shops. Also check out Star Computer City in the Star House near the Star Ferry terminal. Furniture. The choice ranges from traditional hand-carved Chinese rosewood furniture to well-made reproductions of modern Western styles. Rattan furniture is highly popular. Hollywood Road has several furniture shops. Queen’s Road East in Wan Chai is a furniture manufacturing and retail area. Jade. “ Good for the health” is just one of the many magical qualities that are attributed to these beautiful emerald-green or turquoise stones. Real jade is extremely expensive, and you may be offered counterfeit jade, which looks exactly like the genuine article. Some people say you can test the authenticity by touch — real jade feels smooth and cool. Alternatively, you can shine a lamp on the stone — real jade shows no reflected light. Better still, go shopping with an expert. Jewelry. Thanks to the duty-free situation, prices in Hong Kong are lower than they are in some other places. You can buy gemstones loose or set, or have them made up to your own design. Popular purchases include diamonds and freshwater pearls. If you do plan to buy jewelry, be sure to consult the “Shopping Guide to Jewellery” published by the Hong Kong Tourist Authority to find a reputable dealer. Kitchen Equipment. Woks and any other gadgets essential for Chinese cookery make good purchases. Department stores sell all sorts of intriguing kitchen equipment. Leather Goods. Leather is not a great bargain in Hong Kong. Locally made items do not live up to their European models. However, the leather garment industry is growing, and there is a wide range of locally produced leather accessories, all at extremely attractive prices. For European imports, you will pay top dollar. Musical, Audio, and Video Equipment. Hong Kong has a vast range of the most high-tech audio-visual, sound, and screen equipment. Before purchasing, visitors should make sure of compatibility with systems in their own countries. Be sure to look around and compare before buying. Whatever you buy, you may be able to work out a discount. Ready-to-wear Clothes. Hong Kong’s shops carry almost every recognizable European and many American labels, from top-end designers to the moderately priced or trendy. Nathan Road, Central, and the hotel malls are places to look. There are still a great many factory outlet stores with reasonable prices. You’ll also find bargain clothes for sale at the markets and on push-carts. Tailoring. Tailor-made clothes are not as popular in Hong Kong as they were in the past, but hundreds of shops still remain. Local tailors are experts when it comes to producing custom-tailored garments for both men and women, and are also adept at copying patterns. The result can be a quality suit at a fair price — but made-to-measure clothing is not cheap. In choosing a tailor, look for HKTA membership. Many tailors have Web sites or are listed on Web sites. Tea. Shops all over town will sell you gift tins of exotic blends. If you want to learn something about tea, go to the Tea Shop at 149 Hollywood Road, or the Moon Garden Tea House at 5 Hoi Ping Road, Causeway Bay. The owners will brew up a pot so you can taste before making a choice. Watches. The saying “Time is money” is quite literally true in Hong Kong: more is spent on watches and clocks here than on cameras and optical goods. An enormous variety of makes and models are on sale. Be sure to get the manufacturer’s guarantee stamped or signed if you buy a watch. Entertainment Day and night, the action goes on in this vibrant city. To help you choose a nightlife scene, pick up a copy of Hong Kong Tourist Authority’s dining and entertainment guide for listings, or just simply wander through the maze of neon signs and take your pick.

Hong Kong Life is published by the Hong Kong Standard on Sunday, and the South China Morning Post has an entertainment section on Friday.

Both the term and the specific exercise method were developed by Dr. Kenneth Cooper, M.D., an exercise physiologist, and Col. Pauline Potts, a physical therapist, both of the United States Air Force. Dr. Cooper, an avowed exercise enthusiast, was personally and professionally puzzled about why some people with excellent muscular strength were still prone to poor performance at tasks such as long-distance running, swimming, and bicycling. He began measuring systematic human performance using a bicycle ergometer, and began measuring sustained performance in terms of a person's ability to use oxygen. His groundbreaking book, Aerobics, was published in 1968, and included scientific exercise programs using running, walking, swimming and bicycling. The book came at a fortuitous historical moment, when increasing weakness and inactivity in the general population was causing a perceived need for increased exercise.

Burke served as the private secretary to the Marquis of Rockingham and as official pamphleteer to the Rockingham branch of the Whig party. Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom. Burke's views were a mixture of liberal and conservative. He supported the American Revolution of 1765-1783 but abhorred the violence of the French Revolution (1789- ). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of Adam Smith (1723-1790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to aristocracy. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition, and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders. That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive. He favored an established church, but allowed for a degree of religious toleration. Burke justified the social order on the basis of tradition: tradition represented the wisdom of the species and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms. Burke was a leading theorist in his day, finding extreme idealism (either Tory or Whig) an endangerment to broader liberties, and (like Hume) rejecting abstract reason as an unsound guide for political theory. Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of toryism, whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.

Shortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke but from his predecessor, the Viscount Bolingbroke (1678-1751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as Catholic Emancipation and American independence (famously attacked by Samuel Johnson in "Taxation No Tyranny"). In the first half of the 19th century many newspapers, magazines, and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics, and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned but William Pitt the Younger (1759-1806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included The Quarterly Review, founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' Edinburgh Review, and the even more conservative Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. Sack finds that the Quarterly Review promoted a balanced Canningite toryism; was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws. It was "aggressively imperialist". The high-church clergy of the Church of England read the Orthodox Churchman's Magazine which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, Jacobin, Methodist, and Unitarian spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra tories, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine stood firmly against Catholic emancipation, and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the Navigation acts, and the Holy Alliance.

wiki_cucurbita.xml	represented	DYNAMIC	They are often represented in Moche ceramics from Peru.	Cucurbita fruits have played a role in human culture for at least 2,000 years. They are often represented in Moche ceramics from Peru. After Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World, paintings of squashes started to appear in Europe early in the sixteenth century. Among other uses, Cucurbita seeds have been employed in traditional medicine, and extracts are used in cosmetics for dry and sensitive skin. The fruits have many culinary uses including pumpkin pie, biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, and soups. Pumpkins and other Cucurbita fruits are celebrated in festivals and in flower and vegetable shows in many countries.
wiki_cucurbita.xml	found	STATIVE	Modern-day cultivated Cucurbita are not found in the wild.	The ancestral species of the genus Cucurbita were present in the Americas before the arrival of humans, and are native to the New World. The likely center of origin is southern Mexico, spreading south into what is now known as Mesoamerica and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, and no species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. C. moschata can intercross with all the others, though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become polyploid. The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated Cucurbita are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene nad1 show there were at least six independent domestication events of Cucurbita separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include C. digitata (calabazilla), and C. foetidissima (buffalo gourd), C. palmata (coyote melon), and C. pepo. Some species, such as C. digitata and C. ficifolia, are referred to as gourds. Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus Lagenaria and are native to Africa. Lagenaria are in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe.

wiki_cucurbita.xml	provided	DYNAMIC	Later, more accurate, dating using accelerator mass spectrometers provided more specific dates.	The earliest known evidence of the domestication of Cucurbita dates back 8,000–10,000 years ago, predating the domestication of other crops such as maize and beans in the region by about 4,000 years. This evidence was found in the Guilá Naquitz cave in Oaxaca, Mexico, during a series of excavations in the 1960s and 1970s, possibly beginning in 1959. Later, more accurate, dating using accelerator mass spectrometers provided more specific dates. Solid evidence of domesticated C. pepo was found in the Guilá Naquitz cave in the form of increasing rind thickness and larger peduncles in the newer stratification layers of the cave. By circa 8,000 years BP the C. pepo peduncles found are consistently more than thick. Wild Cucurbita peduncles are always below this 10 mm barrier. Changes in fruit shape and color indicate that intentional breeding of C. pepo had occurred by no later than 8,000 years BP. During the same time frame, average rind thickness increased from to .

Squash was domesticated first, followed by maize and then beans, becoming part of the Three Sisters agricultural system of companion planting. The English word "squash" derives from askutasquash (a green thing eaten raw), a word from the Narragansett language, which was documented by Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, in his 1643 publication A Key Into the Language of America. Similar words for squash exist in related languages of the Algonquian family.

wiki_flutina.xml	mounted	DYNAMIC	The brass reed tongues are mounted on reed shoes, with each tongue nailed on with a single metal pin.	The internal construction of the flutina resembles the English Wheatstone concertina more than the "reed banks" used in regular accordion construction. Thus, it has a concertina-like sound. Underneath the pallet/keyboard face, there is a rectangular, wooden board, reed pan, with reed chambers, made with airtight, leather covered, thin wooden dividers. These dividers are between the reeds, for the diatonic scale notes. The brass reed tongues are mounted on reed shoes, with each tongue nailed on with a single metal pin. These reed shoes (or frames) are inserted into dovetail-shaped slots into the top side of the pan. If the keyboard has two rows of keys, the outside row plays the diatonic scale, while the inside row plays the sharps and flats, and these chromatic reeds face the interior of the bellows, in dovetailed slots on the backside of the pan board, without any dividers. The face of the pallet/keyboard actually slides out to reveal the inset reed pan, reminiscent of the construction of a pencil box, or a Japanese puzzle box. The accordion bellows has a very short "throw" (the maximum extension of the bellows, when drawn out), with most instruments having only four folds. Larger versions had 5 to 7 folds in the bellows. The use of the 4 fold bellows made the duration of the note played very short, and the volume of the note comparatively soft, in contrast to the later "German" style accordions, with their larger, multi-fold bellows.

Demian also produced some Accordions with a single note per button "on the draw" or, "on the press". One of his models, had single notes and two rows of keys: first row the diatonic scale, the second row played the accidentals. The accordion tutor published in the Year of 1833 by Adolph Müller (Austrian National Bibliotheca) has an example which includes pictures and descriptions of many different models. A music journal of Paris, printed in the year of 1831, has many details about the beginning of accordion production in Paris. The article starts out with the statement that the first accordion was copied from a Demian instrument, and later, Demian invented many different scale systems, but only later French models had some buttons in the second row being divided in the middle.

A guillotine (; ɡijɔtin) is an apparatus designed for carrying out executions by beheading. It consists of a tall upright frame in which a weighted and angled blade is raised to the top and suspended. The condemned person is secured at the bottom of the frame, with his or her neck held directly below the blade. The blade is then released, to fall swiftly and sever the head from the body. The device is best known for its use in France, in particular during the French Revolution, when it "became a part of popular culture" and it was celebrated as the people's avenger by supporters of the Revolution and vilified as the pre-eminent symbol of the Reign of Terror by opponents. The guillotine continued to be used long after the Revolution and remained France's standard method of judicial execution until the abolition of capital punishment with the backing of President François Mitterrand in 1981. The last person guillotined in France was Hamida Djandoubi, on 10 September 1977.

Although the guillotine was invented in the late 18th century, similar beheading machines have a longer history. The Halifax Gibbet was a wooden structure of two wooden uprights, capped by a horizontal beam, of a total height of . The blade was an axe head weighing 3.5 kg (7.7 lb), attached to the bottom of a massive wooden block that slid up and down in grooves in the uprights. This device was mounted on a large square platform high. It is not known when the Halifax Gibbet was first used; the first recorded execution in Halifax dates from 1280, but that execution may have been by sword, axe, or the gibbet. The machine remained in use until Oliver Cromwell forbade capital punishment for petty theft. It was used for the last time, for the execution of two criminals on a single day, on 30 April 1650.

wiki_monarchy.xml	fixed	STATIVE	Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch’s reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance.	A monarchy is a form of government in which sovereignty is actually or nominally embodied in 1 or 2 individual(s) (the monarch(s)). Forms of monarchy differ widely based on the level of legal autonomy the monarch holds in governance, the method of selection of the monarch, and any predetermined limits on the length of their tenure. When the monarch has no or few legal restraints in state and political matters, it is called an absolute monarchy and is a form of autocracy. Cases in which the monarch's discretion is formally limited (most common today) are called constitutional monarchies. In hereditary monarchies, the office is passed through inheritance within a family group, whereas elective monarchies use some system of voting. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are eligible, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch’s reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.
wiki_monarchy.xml	appear	STATIVE	Although they reign under constitutions, the monarchs of Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland appear to continue to exercise more political influence than any other single source of authority in their nations, either by constitutional mandate or by tradition.	Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 44 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 16 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia "reign, but do not rule" although there is considerable variation in the degree of authority they wield.

Protestantism diffused on the European continent during the 16th century. Lutheranism spread from Germany into its surrounding areas, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Prussia, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as other smaller territories. Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions, Hungary, the Netherlands, Scotland, Switzerland, and France by such reformers as John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and John Knox. Arminianism gained supporters in the Netherlands and parts of Germany. In 1534, King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon; this opened the door to reformational ideas, notably during the following reign of Edward VI, through Thomas Cranmer, Richard Hooker, and other theologians. There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation — a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers — which gave rise to Anabaptist, Moravian, and other Pietistic movements. In later centuries, Protestants developed their own culture, which made major contributions in education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy and the arts, and other fields.

Psychologists explore concepts such as perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some—especially clinical and counseling psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a "hub science", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, and the humanities, such as philosophy.

The study of psychology in a philosophical context dates back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Persia. Historians note that Greek philosophers, including Thales, Plato, and Aristotle (especially in his De Anima treatise), covered the workings of the mind in their writings.

wiki_psychology.xml	credited	STATIVE	German physician Wilhelm Wundt is credited with introducing psychological discovery into a laboratory setting.	German physician Wilhelm Wundt is credited with introducing psychological discovery into a laboratory setting. Known as the "father of experimental psychology", he founded the first psychological laboratory, at Leipzig University, in 1879. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material. Although Wundt, himself, was not a structuralist, his student Edward Titchener, a major figure in early American psychology, was a structuralist thinker opposed to functionalist approaches.
wiki_psychology.xml	laid	DYNAMIC	In his book, The Principles of Psychology, published in 1890, he laid the foundations for many of the questions that psychologists would explore for years to come.	Functionalism formed as a reaction to the theories of the structuralist school of thought and was heavily influenced by the work of the American philosopher, scientist, and psychologist William James. James felt that psychology should have practical value, and that psychologists should find out how the mind can function to a person's benefit. In his book, The Principles of Psychology, published in 1890, he laid the foundations for many of the questions that psychologists would explore for years to come. Other major functionalist thinkers included John Dewey and Harvey Carr.
wiki_psychology.xml	provided	DYNAMIC	These were largely considered taboo subjects at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society.	From the 1890s until his death in 1939, the Austrian physician Sigmund Freud developed psychoanalysis, which comprised a method of investigating the mind and interpreting experience; a systematized set of theories about human behavior; and a form of psychotherapy to treat psychological or emotional distress, especially unconscious conflict. Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection and clinical observations. It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality, repression, and the unconscious mind as general aspects of psychological development. These were largely considered taboo subjects at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society. Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of free association and a therapeutic interest in dream interpretation.
wiki_psychology.xml	maintained	STATIVE	Meanwhile, however, researchers in the emerging field of neuro-psychoanalysis defended some of Freud's ideas on scientific grounds, while scholars of the humanities maintained that Freud was not a "scientist at all, but ... an interpreter."	Psychoanalytic theory and therapy were criticized by psychologists such as Hans Eysenck, and by philosophers including Karl Popper. Popper, a philosopher of science, argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as a scientific discipline, whereas Eysenck said that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental data. By the end of 20th century, psychology departments in American universities had become scientifically oriented, marginalizing Freudian theory and dismissing it as a "desiccated and dead" historical artifact. Meanwhile, however, researchers in the emerging field of neuro-psychoanalysis defended some of Freud's ideas on scientific grounds, while scholars of the humanities maintained that Freud was not a "scientist at all, but ... an interpreter."

Some species also have additional shorter scales in the pappus, and there is one species that lacks a pappus entirely. Another technical feature that distinguishes the genus more reliably, but requires a microscope to see, is the presence of a prominent, multicellular appendage at the apex of the style.

There is quite a bit of variability among the perennial species that make up the bulk of the species in the genus. Some have most or all of the large leaves in a rosette at the base of the plant and produce a flowering stem that has leaves that are reduced in size. Most of the perennials have disk flowers that are entirely yellow, but a few have disk flowers with reddish lobes. One species, H. radula, lacks ray flowers altogether.
wiki_sunflower.xml	listed	DYNAMIC	Whorled sunflowers, Helianthus verticillatus, were listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S.	The domesticated sunflower, Helianthus annuus, is the most familiar species. Perennial sunflower species are not as popular for gardens due to their tendency to spread rapidly and become invasive. Whorled sunflowers, Helianthus verticillatus, were listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to six feet tall and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.

wiki_theocracy.xml	defined	DYNAMIC	The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ecclesiocracy.	Taken literally or strictly, theocracy means rule by God or gods and refers primarily to an internal "rule of the heart", especially in its biblical application. The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ecclesiocracy.
wiki_theocracy.xml	claim	DYNAMIC	An ecclesiocracy, on the other hand, is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation.	In a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the civilization's religion or belief. For example, Moses led the Israelites, and Muhammad ruled the early Muslims. Law proclaimed by the ruler is also considered a divine revelation, and hence the law of God. An ecclesiocracy, on the other hand, is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation. For example, the prince-bishops of the European Middle Ages, where the bishop was also the temporal ruler. Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the religion for its own administration, or it may have two 'arms' — administrators and clergy — but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy. The papacy in the Papal States occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, since the pope did not claim he was a prophet who received revelation from God and translated it into civil law.

wiki_theocracy.xml	is	DYNAMIC	Theocracy is distinguished from other, secular forms of government that have a state religion, or are influenced by theological or moral concepts, and monarchies held "By the Grace of God".	Theocracy is distinguished from other, secular forms of government that have a state religion, or are influenced by theological or moral concepts, and monarchies held "By the Grace of God". In the most common usage of the term, some civil rulers are leaders of the dominant religion (e.g., the Byzantine emperor as patron and defender of the official Church); the government proclaims it rules on behalf of God or a higher power, as specified by the local religion, and divine approval of government institutions and laws. These characteristics apply also to a caesaropapist regime. The Byzantine Empire however was not theocratic since the patriarch answered to the emperor, not vice versa; similarly in Tudor England the crown forced the church to break away from Rome so the royal (and, especially later, parliamentary) power could assume full control of the now Anglican hierarchy and confiscate most church property and income.

wiki_theocracy.xml	governed	DYNAMIC	For example, in Israel marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion, for atheists, for example) exists nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.	Secular governments can also co-exist with a state religion or delegate some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in Israel marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion, for atheists, for example) exists nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions. India similarly delegates control of marriage and some other civil matters to the religious communities, in large part as a way of accommodating its Muslim minority.
wiki_theocracy.xml	recognized	STATIVE	Josephus argued that while the Greeks recognized three types of government: monarchy, aristocracy, and anarchy, the Jews were unique in that they had a system of government that did not fit into those categories.	It was first coined by Josephus Flavius in the first century A.D. to describe the characteristic government for Jews. Josephus argued that while the Greeks recognized three types of government: monarchy, aristocracy, and anarchy, the Jews were unique in that they had a system of government that did not fit into those categories. Josephus understood theocracy as a fourth form of government in which only God and his law is sovereign. Josephus' definition was widely accepted until the Enlightenment era, when the term started to collect more universalistic and negative connotations, especially in Hegel's hands. The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning "sacerdotal government under divine inspiration" (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning "priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power" is recorded from 1825.
